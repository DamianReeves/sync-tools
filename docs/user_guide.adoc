== Overview

This document explains how to use the Python-based `sync_tools` wrapper and
associated utilities. It covers CLI usage, configuration, filters, the parity
harness, and recommended CI integration.

== Installation

A minimal setup uses Python 3.12 and the provided virtualenv pattern. From the
repository root:

----
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
----

=== Installable distribution

We publish installable distributions (sdist + wheel) on GitHub Releases. Once
released you can install with pip directly from the wheel or from PyPI if
published there:

----
# From a downloaded wheel
pip install ./sync_tools-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl

# From a source checkout
pip install -e .
----
== CLI

The main Python CLI is in `sync_tools/cli.py` and exposes the same options as the
legacy `sync.sh` script but with enhanced logging and reporting.


- `--source`, `--dest` — Source and destination
- `--mode` — one-way or two-way
- `--dry-run` — run rsync with `--dry-run`
- `-v`/`--log-level` — control verbosity
- `--dump-commands PATH` — write a JSON dump of rsync command + filters
- `--report PATH` — write a Markdown report of Added/Updated/Deleted/Excluded
- `--list-filtered {src,dst,both}` — locally list files that would be filtered

== Filters and Patterns
Filters support rsync-like patterns including `*`, `?`, `**`, trailing `/` to
indicate directories, and `!` for explicit includes (unignore). The Python
matcher attempts to mirror rsync semantics; however, exact 1:1 parity is

Use `--only` (whitelist) to create an include-only filter set. Files can be
specified absolute (leading `/`) or relative.

=== Using a GitHub ZIP download URL as source

You can pass an HTTP(S) URL that points to a ZIP archive (for example a GitHub
archive or release asset) as the `--source`. The CLI will download and
unpack the archive into a temporary directory and run the sync against the
extracted tree. This is useful for quick one-off syncs from a repo snapshot.

----
sync-tools sync --source "https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" --dest /backup --only '/docs/' --dry-run
----

The downloaded archive is cleaned up after the run.
== Parity Harness
A diagnostic tool `tools/rsync_parity_harness.py` is provided to compare the
Python matcher against rsync's own decision logic.


- Runs `rsync --dry-run --out-format='%i %n'` from `src/` to an empty temp
  dir and captures the files rsync would transfer
- Walks the source tree and compares `decision_for_path` results to rsync's
- Prints mismatches and (optionally) writes a JSON diagnostic file with

=== Basic usage

----
PYTHONPATH=. python tools/rsync_parity_harness.py --src /path/to/src --pattern '*.py' --pattern '!keep.py'
----

To request JSON diagnostics explicitly:
----
----

When the harness finds mismatches it exits with code 2 and writes the JSON
path.
=== Example CI step (GitHub Actions)

[source,yaml]
- name: Parity check
    PYTHONPATH=. python tools/rsync_parity_harness.py --src test_folders --pattern '*.txt' --pattern '!keep.txt' --dump-json parity.json || true
    if [ -f parity.json ]; then
      echo "Uploading parity.json as artifact"
      # upload artifact step here
    fi
----

=== Release artifacts from CI

The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that builds sdist and wheel
when a tag matching `v*.*.*` is pushed and publishes them to a GitHub Release.
The uploaded `dist/` artifacts contain both the `.tar.gz` source and the
`.whl` wheel which you can download and install with pip as shown above.

== Reports

The CLI can create a Markdown report summarizing Added/Updated/Deleted and
Excluded-by-filters. Use `--report report.md` to generate this file. You can
extend the report by stat'ing files for size/mtime.

== Troubleshooting

- If the harness shows mismatches, inspect the JSON file to see per-path
  decisions from Python and rsync's included set.
- Some complex rsync filter precedence cases are easier to diagnose by
  creating a minimal reproduction tree and running the harness against it.

== Development notes

Contributions to the matcher should include unit tests in `tests/test_pattern_matching.py`.
