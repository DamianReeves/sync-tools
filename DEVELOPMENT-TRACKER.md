## Changelog

### 2025-08-29: Git Patch Generation Feature Complete with Report Integration
**Completed Work**:
- âœ… **Git Patch Generation Feature** [Priority: P1 - High]
  - Added --patch CLI flag to sync command for patch generation instead of syncing
  - Implemented git diff-based patch creation with proper header metadata  
  - Added support for dry-run patch preview functionality
  - Integrated with existing filter system (respects .syncignore, whitelist mode, etc.)
  - Created comprehensive BDD test suite with 6 scenarios covering all use cases
  - All BDD scenarios passing: patch creation, new files, deletions, ignore patterns, whitelist mode, dry-run
  - **Enhanced --report flag with intelligent format detection** for .patch/.diff files

**Key Outcomes**:
- Users can now generate git patch files instead of performing actual sync operations
- Patch files are properly formatted with git diff format for easy review and application
- Feature respects all existing filtering rules and configurations
- Dry-run mode shows what would be included in patch without creating files
- Complete BDD test coverage ensures feature reliability and prevents regressions
- **Dual patch generation methods**: --patch flag OR --report with .patch/.diff extension
- **Intelligent format detection** eliminates need for additional CLI flags

**Technical Implementation**:
- Extended rsync.Options struct with Patch field
- Added generatePatch method with git diff integration and fallback
- Integrated patch mode detection in main Sync workflow
- **Added file extension-based format detection** for --report flag (.patch, .diff)
- BDD tests validate all scenarios: mixed files, new files, deletions, filters, whitelist, dry-run
- Updated documentation with comprehensive examples and usage patterns

### 2025-08-29: Go Migration and BDD Framework Complete
**Completed Work**:
- âœ… **Python to Go Migration** [Priority: P0 - Critical] 
  - Completely removed all legacy Python code and build scripts
  - Migrated to Go CLI framework using Cobra
  - Updated Makefile with Go-specific build targets
  - Preserved all functionality from Python implementation

- âœ… **BDD Testing Framework Integration** [Priority: P1 - High]
  - Integrated Godog for behavior-driven development
  - Created comprehensive feature files (basic_sync.feature, ignore_patterns.feature, hello_world.feature)
  - Implemented Go step definitions for all test scenarios
  - Established red-green-refactor development cycle

- âœ… **Core Functionality Verification** [Priority: P1 - High]
  - Verified all ReadMe.adoc examples work correctly
  - Tested one-way sync (dry-run and execution)
  - Verified two-way sync functionality
  - Confirmed .syncignore and .gitignore import features
  - Validated TOML configuration file support
  - Tested whitelist/only mode functionality

**Key Outcomes**:
- Go implementation provides better performance and single-binary distribution
- BDD tests are running and providing clear development guidance
- All core sync functionality verified as working correctly
- Project structure aligned with Go best practices
- Development workflow established with comprehensive testing

**Architectural Decisions Made**:
- Chose Godog over other Go BDD frameworks for better Gherkin integration
- Maintained existing CLI interface for backward compatibility
- Used structured logging (logrus) for better debugging and audit trails
- Preserved layered filtering architecture from Python implementation

## Current Architecture Status

### Go CLI Framework âœ… Complete

- **Configuration**: TOML-based config with CLI override support
- **Logging**: Structured logging with multiple verbosity levels
- **Error Handling**: Proper error propagation and user-friendly messages

### Filter Engine âœ… Complete
- **Layered Filtering**: .syncignore, .gitignore import, CLI patterns
- **Whitelist Mode**: Exclusive path inclusion with --only flags
- **Pattern Matching**: Full rsync filter compatibility
- **Default Exclusions**: Automatic .git/ exclusion

### Rsync Wrapper âœ… Complete  
- **Command Generation**: Dynamic rsync command construction
- **Filter Files**: Temporary filter file management
- **Output Processing**: Real-time stdout/stderr capture
- **Exit Code Handling**: Proper error detection and reporting

### BDD Test Framework âœ… Complete
- **Godog Integration**: Full cucumber/gherkin support
- **Step Definitions**: Comprehensive test scenario coverage
- **Test Isolation**: Independent test execution with cleanup
- **CI Ready**: Tests integrated into make targets

### Configuration System âœ… Complete
