- Visual categorization of changes with emoji indicators (üìÑ for files, üìÅ for directories, üîÑ for updates, ‚ùå for deletes)
- Report generation works in both dry-run and actual sync modes
- When not in dry-run, performs actual sync after generating the report

**Technical Implementation**:
- Added SyncChange and SyncReport structs for structured data collection
- Implemented collectSyncInfo method using rsync's --itemize-changes format

### 2025-08-29: Git Patch Generation Feature Complete with Preview and Apply Support
**Completed Work**:
- ‚úÖ **Git Patch Generation Feature** [Priority: P1 - High]
  - Added --patch CLI flag to sync command for patch generation instead of syncing
  - Implemented git diff-based patch creation with proper header metadata  
  - Added support for dry-run patch preview functionality
  - Integrated with existing filter system (respects .syncignore, whitelist mode, etc.)
  - Created comprehensive BDD test suite with 6 scenarios covering all use cases
  - All BDD scenarios passing: patch creation, new files, deletions, ignore patterns, whitelist mode, dry-run
  - **Enhanced --report flag with intelligent format detection** for .patch/.diff files
  - **Added --apply-patch flag** to apply generated patches with user confirmation
  - **Added -y/--yes flag** for automatic confirmation (Unix-style)
  - **Added --preview flag** for colored diff preview with paging support
  - **Enhanced SyncFile format** with patch instructions: PATCH, APPLYPATCH, PREVIEW, AUTOCONFIRM

**Key Outcomes**:
- Users can now generate git patch files instead of performing actual sync operations
- Patch files are properly formatted with git diff format for easy review and application
- Feature respects all existing filtering rules and configurations
- Dry-run mode shows what would be included in patch without creating files
- Complete BDD test coverage ensures feature reliability and prevents regressions
- **Dual patch generation methods**: --patch flag OR --report with .patch/.diff extension
- **Intelligent format detection** eliminates need for additional CLI flags
- **Interactive patch workflow**: preview, generate, apply, and confirm patches
- **Declarative patch operations**: SyncFile support for all patch functionality

**Technical Implementation**:
- Extended rsync.Options struct with Patch field
- Added generatePatch method with git diff integration and fallback
- Integrated patch mode detection in main Sync workflow
- **Added file extension-based format detection** for --report flag (.patch, .diff)
- **Extended SyncFile with 4 new instructions** for comprehensive patch workflow support
- BDD tests validate all scenarios: mixed files, new files, deletions, filters, whitelist, dry-run
- Updated documentation with comprehensive examples and usage patterns
- Enhanced syncfile --list output to display all patch-related configuration

### 2025-08-29: Go Migration and BDD Framework Complete
